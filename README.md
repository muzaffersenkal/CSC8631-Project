## About The Project

Businesses are making effort to achieve an edge with its content marketing program. Showing an article's reading time to each of article can have a profound and positive effect on reader engagement levels. The first benefit is that users to help them choose the right article for the right amount of available time they have. Another advantage is that estimated reading time impacts engagement metrics seriously. Lastly, it helps to make analyzes according to certain groups.

Reading time is calculated based on the number of words read by the average human per minute. Generally, this average value per minute is between 200 and 250 words. Therefore, the total number of words in the article is divided by this determined average.

However, scientific articles are not like blog posts. Reading time varies according to one's knowledge, age, country even article subject .For example, professionals can read articles more quickly than students or older people read slower. Hence, we are not making an accurate estimate by using the conventional calculation method.

In this study, the data will be analyzed and the article reading time will be examined in which groups and how it changes. Then, a regression model using these features will be developed that can predict article reading time on a per-person basis.

## Deliverables

-   Report file  => `reports/report.RMD` or `reports/report.pdf`.
-   Critical reflection report file => `reports/short_report.RMD` or `reports/short_report.pdf`.
-   Presentation pdf =>  `docs/Presentation.pdf` or `docs/Presentation.pptx`.
-   Presentation video  =>  `docs/Presentation.mp4`.
-   Git Log file => `logs/210351491_GitLogFile.txt`.

## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally. To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.


### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.

-   R

-   ProjectTemplate

    ``` sh
    install.packages('ProjectTemplate')
    ```

### Installation

1.  Clone the repo

    ``` sh
    git clone https://github.com/muzaffersenkal/CSC8631-Project
    ```

2.  Load Project

    ``` sh
    library('ProjectTemplate')
    load.project()
    ```

## Usage

After you enter the second line of code, you'll see a series of automated messages as ProjectTemplate goes about doing its work. This work involves:

-   Reading in the global configuration file contained in `config`.
-   Loading any R packages you listed in the configuration file.
-   Datasets stored in `data` or `cache`.
-   Preprocessing the data using the files in the `munge` directory.
-   Reports files are in the `reports` directory.
-   Analysis are in the `src` directory.
